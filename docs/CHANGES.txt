Consolidated commit list since 2014-04-20:

Fix some LTR issues (bug thread 189685)
Move loading comments before View::show_header. This should fix subscriptions and quote notifications appearing when a user is already on the page of that last subscription
Replace some hardcoded IRC channels with configuration parameters
Fix HTML in <title> for non-{Music, Audiobooks, Comedy} requests (bug thread 189855)
Fix: link directly to the torrent on bad files/folders better.php pages (thread 190009)
Update internal cache when a cache key is changed
This should make quote notifications disappear when viewing threads (#183300)
Cast user id to int on user profile pages to get rid of trailing period
Remove WhatMan's spellcheck tool (seriously it was crap)
Fix a few cache key typos:
    Blog => blog
    requests_$RequestID => request_$RequestID
    users_stats_$UserID => user_stats_$UserID
Fix some sorting issues related to Torrents::get_groups not returning the groups in the same order they were passed in; DO NOT iterate over Torrents::get_groups results...
Fix image in bookmarks JSON API
Fix comments appearing on the wrong page (bug thread 190203)
Passwords aren't limited to 40 characters
Fix better.php/single and rename some variables so they make some sense
    Bug thread #190289
Don't continue to process forum post deletes if the post or thread doesn't exist
Trusting rdns is bad
Fix two cache issues in the schedule
    - Permissions of users that are demoted to User/Member for low ratio or upload were not updated/cleared, which meant that e.g. demoted PU users could still see the PU forum
    - The cache was cleared before the promotion/demotion queries. This could cause a race condition if the cache key were filled again (through a Users::user_info call)
Fix some cache issues (bug thread 190802)
Speed up BBCode
BBCode profiling
Fix a bunch of bookmarks stuff. HTML/CSS consistency, jQuerified functions
