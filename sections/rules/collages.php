			<li>Collages in the Discography, Staff Picks, Label, and Charts categories must be based on fact, and not opinion. If something is a published Best Of (for instance, "Pitchfork's Best Albums of the 1990's") then it should go in the Charts category.</li>

			<li>
			Collages in the Personal, Theme, and Genre Introductions categories may be based on opinion. You must respect others' opinions whilst creating and populating Theme and Genre Introduction collages.
			</li>
			<li>
			Vandalizing of collages will be taken very seriously, resulting in collage editing privileges being removed (at a minimum).
			</li>
			<li>
			Personal Best Of collages are only allowed in the new Personal Collages category. You must be a Power User+ or Donor to create one.
			</li>
			<li>
			A well-defined group of people, for instance Torrent Masters, or Interviewers, may create a Group Picks Theme collage with one pick per person, after having gained permission for the collage from Staff.
			</li>
			<li>
			There may only be one collage per Genre Introduction/Theme. Dupe collages will be deleted.
			</li>
			<li>
			Theme/Genre Introduction collages must be sensible, and reasonably broad. Those that do not fit this description will be deleted.
			</li>
			<li>
			Collages are not an alternative to the tagging system. A collage such as 'mathcore torrents' wouldn't be allowed, because it is far more appropriate to just tag the torrents as mathcore. Of course, an 'xysite.com worst 50 mathcore albums' collage would be looked upon differently.
			</li>
			<li>
			Collages should not be used to create artist discographies, as the artist pages already exist for this purpose. However, for an artist who has a multitude of side projects, it is allowed to create a collage containing all of the projects, to be placed in the Discography category.
			</li>
			<li>
			Power Users and Donors get one personal collage. Elites can have two, Torrent Masters can have up to three, Power TMs up to four and Elite TM+ up to five. Donors always receive one more than the class maximum.
			</li>
			<li>
			Every collage must have at least 3 torrent groups in it, except for collages of type "Label", "Personal", and "Staff Picks".
			</li>
			<li>
			Please check to see that a similar collage does not already exist. If a similar collage does exist, please contribute to the existing collage.
			</li>
			<li>
			Please give your collage an appropriate title and a decent description explaining its purpose.
			</li>
			<li>
			Please attempt to add album art to every torrent in your collage.
			</li>
